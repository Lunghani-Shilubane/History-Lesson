# History Lesson
History lesson is a mini-study game which uses flashcards to help someone catch up or refresh on the history study material. History Lesson is here to revolutionise the world of educational prep, one subject at a time. With this being the app's first iteration, it will only cover history material, but later iterations will include more subjects based on the level of education.

## Design Considerations:
The app is designed to be simple and easy to use, and it is available on multiple Android versions to ensure that no one is left out.
 
### The first page:
 
Contains the app's name and a little information to introduce and explain what the app is about. Under that, there’s an input field where the user can input a username they want to use in the app, and a button that will pass the username to the next page.

### The second page:
 
This is the questions and flashcards page. There is an array of 5 questions and another of 5 answers. The true or false buttons correspond with the answers to the questions. Once one of the buttons is pressed, the answer given is checked against the correct answer. 
If the correct choice is made, a green overlay appears on the card with text that indicates that the player’s answer was correct.
 
If the wrong answer is chosen, a red overlay appears on the card with text that indicates that the player’s answer is wrong. After answering all the questions, the results button will appear, which will take the player to the results page.

 ### The third page:
The Results page contains the results from the quiz. The player will be able to see how many questions they got wrong and how many they got right. This page welcomes the player and displays the username entered on the first page. As well as the results, there are also buttons to review the quiz and to shut down the app.

 
When the review button is clicked, the player will be able to see each question with the corresponding given answers, and a little message that says that the answer is correct or wrong and a “good job” or a “take some time to revise and try again, if the answer is correct or wrong, respectively.
When the “Exit the app” button is clicked, the whole app is shut down, and the player can restart the app to try again.
